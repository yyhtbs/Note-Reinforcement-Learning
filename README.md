# Reinforcement-Learning

Useful Coursera Course:

Reinforcement Learning Specialization, offered by University of Alberta

Link: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning?

I have not uploaded my notes of "Reinforcement Learning Specialization" to this git. Will do it later


In the current version, I have some notes (translated into English) from another RL course (however the course is in Taiwan Chinese). Hope it will be also helpful.
