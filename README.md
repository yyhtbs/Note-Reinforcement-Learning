# Reinforcement-Learning

Useful Coursera Course:

Reinforcement Learning Specialization, offered by University of Alberta
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning?

I have not uploaded my notes of "Reinforcement Learning Specialization" to this git.

In the current version, I have some notes (in English) from another RL course (however the course is in Chinese). Hope it will be helpful.
