## This AI Does Nothing In Games…And Still Wins!

Abstract: Adversarial policies win reliably, despite not really playing the game. 

In the presented examples, the goalies and line-guards seem uncoordinated and often fall to the ground. In the left image above, the state-of the-art line guard tries to block the runner and misses, while the adversarially-trained guard on the right tends to curl up into a ball but wins twice as much. The authors also show that this adversarial approach leads to surprising activations in the defendants' policy networks and that such policies seem more successful in higher-dimensional environments (concretely, human wrestlers versus ant wrestlers with fewer degrees of freedom—but perhaps in Go versus Chess as well?).

Hint: "Freakonomics" Like penalty kick in football game, the shooter should kick the ball to the middle area because the gatekeeper will be the least likely to stay in the middle.
